#### GAME DESIGN


## BeSwitched

During Fall 2019, OSU's Game Creation Club hosted a GameJam, where the members formed teams and raced
to build a fully functional game within 48 hours. Our theme was "Connection".

My group interpreted this as two halves within a whole - light and darkness. The concept behind BeSwitched 
revolves around two main characters: a "good" witch, and a "bad" witch. Both characters are controlled by the player.
The goal of the game is simple: for each level, navigate each witch to their respective portals. However, each level 
is full of obstacles, and the witches are controlled asynchronously - if one moves left, the other moves right, etc.

Future Plans:
- Some further developments we discussed included improving the graphics quality of the games, and creating 
a larger variety of levels.

## Software Design Project

After learning MatLab for the last few weeks, our Fundamentals of Engineering class culminated in a project where we
would try to make a game of our choice in MatLab. We chose to do MatLab, and as an added challenge, created an AI player
that anyone could play against.
