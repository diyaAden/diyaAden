### About


```markdown

My name is Diya, and I'm currently a sophomore at The Ohio State University. My major is Computer Science and Engineering and my minors are Game Studies and Cognitive Science. I've been programming in Java for 
5+ years, and have also gained proficiency in a variety of other languages 
through project work and self-learning.

One of my biggest interests in the tech industry is XR applications. I am 
especially interested in XR applications in game development. Through my 
undergraduate career, I hope to gain experience in a variety of different 
CS disciplines, and increase my knowledge in the subjects as a whole.
