### About


```markdown

My name is Diya, and I'm a rising sophomore at The Ohio State University. I'm 
majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I've been programming in Java for 
5+ years, and have also gained proficiency in a variety of other languages through 
project work and self-learning.

One of my biggest interests in the tech industry is XR applications. I am especially
interested in XR applications in the area of game development. Through my undergraduate
career, I hope to gain experience in a variety of different CS disciplines, and 
increase my knowledge in the subjects as a whole.
